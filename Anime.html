This is a <blink>live feed</blink> from #anime on EFNet...
<P>
If you can't see any text, then either nobody is talking, or the connection is down.
<P>
But then again, if all you get is a blank window, black or grey, then you're probably
behind a firewall, or your ISP doesn't allow persitent connections, or you're on AOL
or my server crashed...
<P>
This page really requires Netscape Navigator Gold 3.0 or Internet Explorer 3.0 to be
be viewed optimally as it places a high demand on the Java engine of both browsers.
